# ❄️ Snowman Saver  

A fun little word-guessing game where you’re racing against the cold!  
Your mission: guess the hidden word before the snowman melts away. Each wrong guess brings him closer to disappearing forever. Can you save him in time?  

---

## 🎮 Gameplay  
- A random word is selected at the start.  
- You have a **limited number of attempts** (e.g., 8).  
- Each incorrect guess makes the snowman melt piece by piece (head, body, arms…).  
- If you guess the full word before he’s gone, you win.  
- If he melts completely, the game is over.
